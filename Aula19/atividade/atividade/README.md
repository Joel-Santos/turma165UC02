# Atividade Project

This project is designed to provide a simple web application that allows users to input data and receive responses based on their inputs. The application consists of several components, including HTML for structure, JavaScript for functionality, and CSS for styling.

## Project Files

- **index.html**: This file contains the structure of the webpage, including sections for user input and buttons to trigger JavaScript functions.

- **script.js**: This file contains the JavaScript code that handles the logic for the webpage, including functions that respond to user interactions.

- **styles/styles.css**: This file contains the CSS styles to enhance the appearance of the webpage, particularly for styling multiple cards.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter the required information in the input fields.
3. Click the corresponding buttons to see the responses generated by the JavaScript functions.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more input fields and corresponding JavaScript functions to handle additional user interactions.
- Improve the styling in `styles/styles.css` to create a more visually appealing layout.
- Implement validation for user inputs to ensure data integrity.
